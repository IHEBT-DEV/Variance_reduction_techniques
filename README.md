# üéØ Variance Reduction Techniques for Monte Carlo Option Pricing

## üìò Introduction

Financial markets are inherently uncertain, and investors often seek protection against adverse price movements using **derivative instruments** such as **options**.  
A common hedging strategy involves buying a **call option** on assets one wishes to acquire and a **put option** on those intended for future sale.

Estimating the fair price of an option is essential for both **hedging** and **speculative** purposes. Since the option value depends on the stochastic evolution of the underlying asset, **Monte Carlo simulations** provide a flexible and powerful tool to approximate expected payoffs ‚Äî particularly when closed-form analytical formulas are unavailable.

In this project, we:

- Model the underlying asset using a **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** process.  
- Estimate European **call** and **put** option prices using **Monte Carlo simulation**.  
- Apply advanced **variance reduction techniques** to improve estimation accuracy:
  - Antithetic Variates  
  - Control Variates  
  - Importance Sampling (fixed and adaptive)
- Use **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** to optimize the *tilt parameter* in Importance Sampling, further minimizing estimator variance and improving convergence.
